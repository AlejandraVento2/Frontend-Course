    "Description": "With a 'no rain or sleet' attitude and a 'kick-your-ass' grace, this delivery captain is a refreshing source of professionalism to counterpoint the rest of the crew. For better or worse, the ship runs on her high octane passions, be it because of her longing for family, her love of violence, her commitment to a job well done, or her affection for animals. She has been known to scrap the missions on a whim on the promise of learning more of her past, jeopardize the crew's lives to spite Zapp Brannigan, and save Nibbler. Leela was the first female Blernsball player and the worst player ever because of her poor depth perception (this is due to the fact that she has one eye). However, in space, depth perception is less useful because things are further away and so Leela is the captain of the Planet Express ship. Later on, she finally met her long lost parents, who turned out to be sewer mutants."

She is the ex-wife of Barbados Slim, the rival of Hermes, to whom she refers as a 'human Adonis' and 'a mahogany god'. Hermes is insecure when Barbados is around and LaBarbara leaves Hermes temporarily in 'Bender's Big Score' to be with Barbados Slim after Hermes loses his body. She often wears clothes that reveal her belly button (like Amy Wong and Leela).",
